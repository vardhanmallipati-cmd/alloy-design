This research analyzes the trade-off between electrical conductivity and mechanical durability in copper alloys containing Titanium, Chromium, and Aluminum for switchgear applications. While alloying and surface treatments like shot peening and plasma nitriding reduce electrical conductivity—dropping from 100% IACS in pure copper to as low as 19-40% IACS with Ti additions—they provide critical enhancements to industrial performance. Plasma nitriding creates hard nitride phases (TiN, CrN, AlN) that can increase surface hardness from ~35 HV to approximately 997 HV, representing a nearly 30-fold improvement that dramatically boosts wear resistance and arc endurance. These modifications are essential for specialized electrical components like contacts and connectors, where mechanical strength and durability are prioritized over maximum bulk conductivity.
